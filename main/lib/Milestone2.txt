Accomplished:
    * Ability to favorite a team and have that display on the favorites tab
    * Ability to click on a player on the players tab and get basic player info
    * Fully implemented the api in order to have true games from a current week
        - As of right now it is hardcoded for week 7
    * Modified the favorites tab to have a nested set of tabs for the teams that the user has favorited
        - Changes when a user favorites or unfavorites a team
        - Default teams of Ravens and Giants hardcoded in

We did not accomplish favoriting a player. Therefore, the favorites tab is still not integrated with players
that are favorited. We also did accomplish adding push notifications for different aspects of the app. For
milestone 3 we plan on having a fully implemented way of favoriting a given player. We also plan on making
the app have a similar design structure across all tabs/pages so the user doesn't have to learn different
things that ultimately display the same information. We also hope to accomplish the ability to have push
notifications. The biggest hurdle that we still have to accomplish is the integration of all pages together.
Having all taken a page to work on and ultimatley designing things slightly different at times, we will need
to make all pages more uniform in design. We did fall slightly behind on our timeline from the initial proposal,
but hope to get back on track by milestone 3.
