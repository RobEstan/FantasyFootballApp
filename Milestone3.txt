Accomplished:
    * Ability to favorite a player  and have that display on the favorites tab
    * Added a push notification for a team's last name
        - Right now this is implemented with a button when on a team's information page
            or that team's tab on the favorites page that sends a notification with the
            score of their last game
    * Added game information when you click on a game from the scores page
    * Ability to click on a team from the standings page and go to that team's info page
    * Added an icon to the app and renamed the app from main to Football

We did not accomplish having a notification drawer for teams and players nor do we have fully functioning
push notifications. We plan on making the notifications appear on their own rather than with a button on
the team's display page. With the limit on API calls/day we will have to determine a way to get the most
out of the API calls/day while getting team/player information that will update during a game in order to
send notifications about that update (i.e. score change, quarter end, player scores). We plan on having
these notifications turned on for only your favorited teams/players and a way to turn them on/off. We also
plan on having more information when looking at the information of a game and a player as well as having all
weeks of the nfl season available on the scores tab.
