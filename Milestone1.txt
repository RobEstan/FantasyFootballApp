Accomplished:
    * Integration of 3rd party API
    * Displaying standings using API
    * Displaying teams using API
    * Displaying team info using API when a team is clicked on the teams page
    * Displaying players using the API
    * Hardcoded games on the scores page

The only thing we did not accomplish was displaying games on the scores page using the API for the entire league.
However, we did figure out how to display the games but did not have enough time to implement that for the scores page.
For milestone 2 our goal is to have a way to actually favorite a team(s) that will be what appears on the favorites tab.
We will also work on displaying actual games/scores from around the league on a given week on the scores tab using the API.
We also still plan on implementing notifications in the next milestone if time allows. Overall, we are still on the basic
timeline set in our initial proposal. The only design changes that we chose to do was to add 2 more tabs then originally planned.
We added the favorites tab and teams tab to our design. Our biggest lessoned learned was that each taking a page ended up not working
out as planned because certain aspects from the API are used on the same pages so we each would do those slightly differently and had
to work around that at times. That never caused a major problem.
