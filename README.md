We developed an NFL app to allow users to check up-to-date information about the NFL, such as scores, standings, players, and teams, as well as to be able to mark teams and players as favorites to find information about them more easily. 

The way it works is that we obtain the up-to-date information from API-Sports (https://dashboard.api-football.com/), which requires the use of a key that we can use in our HTTP get request. We have defined a class to store player, team, standings, and game information, so that we can more easily work with the data. Using the data, we are able to display the information and images in the different tabs and pages of our app. We also use a favorites model to keep track of the teams and players currently marked as favorites so we can display information about them, as well as a games model to keep track of the currently selected game that the user has clicked on for more information about. The motivation for our sports app was to display up-to-date information about the NFL in a visually appealing way and provide features to facilitate a userâ€™s ability to find the sports information that they are interested in. The motivation of developing the sports app was also to demonstrate and acquire skills related to programming handheld systems, especially with processing and storing data retrieved from API calls, keeping tracking of app state, and displaying the information in a nice way
